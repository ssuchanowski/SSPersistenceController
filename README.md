# SSPersistenceController
Core Data boilerplate code with multithread approach (having private queue to handle all data writting). Thanks to that we won't block UI even during massive imports.

# Installation
SSPersistenceController is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'SSPersistenceController'
```

# TODO
* Build better readme
* Add usage samples
